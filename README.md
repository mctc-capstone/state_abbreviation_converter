# Fix Code Quality Issues

This program converts between US state names, and abbreviations. For example, converting "MN" to "Minnesota" or converting "California" to "CA".

## Instructions

1. Copy the repository URL
2. Clone it to your computer 
3. Make a branch with an appropriate name 
4. Fix the code quality issues
5. Push your branch to your fork
6. Make a Pull Request to the original repo
7. Watch for feedback in the PR review

When you create a PR, PyLint will run on your code and make some style checks. If it finds issues, you'll see a failing checks message in your PR. **If all the checks pass, this doesn't mean that everything is good - there are numerous other things that should be fixed that PyLint does not check for.**

## Code quality issues to look for 

* Consistency in using single and double quotes. Single quotes are prefered
* Spelling errors in comments, variable names, messages shown to the user 
* Spacing around operators. Use one space around operators, e.g. `if a == b:` and no space before the : at the end of an `if`, or `for` statement.
* Consistent line spacing between lines of code. Use exactly two blank lines between functions/methods. Avoid blank lines after `for`, `if`, `elif`, `else` and `def` statements. 
* Standard spacing between parameters, use one space after commas, and no spaces around the parenthesis e.g. `example_method(1, var, another_var)`
* Use underscore_names for variables, functions and methods
* There are no classes in this example, but you should use UppercaseCamelCase for class names 
* Remove redundant comments
* Remove unnecessary print statements 
* Remove unused code, variables, and imports
* Avoid very long lines, avoid very complex lines. Revise into two or more shorter, simpler lines. 
* Variable names should be specific and descriptive. `data` is almost always a bad variable name - *everything* is data
* Avoid reasigning variables to store a different type of data
* Repetitive code can often be replaced with a function 
* Complex functions should be broken into simpler functions
* Comments should have a space after the #.  If a comment follows a line of code, preface the comment with two spaces. For example `default = 'cat'  # the most common choice`
